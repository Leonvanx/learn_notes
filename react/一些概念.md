# JSX语法

With JSX, we can write what looks like HTML, and also we can create and use our own XML-like tags. Here's what JSX looks like assigned to a variable.

```js
const heading = <h1 className="site-heading">Hello, React</h1>
```

- `className` is used instead of `class` for adding CSS classes, as `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
- Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase - `onclick` will become `onClick`.
- Self-closing tags *must* end in a slash - e.g. `<img />`

# 类组件和函数组件

> Function Component

```jsx
const SimpleComponent = () => {
  return <div>Example</div>
}
```

> Class Component

```jsx
class ClassComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Example</div>
  }
}
```

Note that if the `return` is contained to one line, it does not need parentheses.
